  "You are in a project where you'll need to improve the training for an LLM (Large Language Model). Given a user's prompt and two AI models' responses, your task is to Determine the rating of each model's answer - Completely Correct, Partially Correct, or Incorrect, using the Correctness Guide. Compare the responses of the two models to find which one has higher quality. Keep in mind the following aspects: Evaluate both responses based on code generation, code explanation, and code commenting. Consider general rules and deal breakers as defined in the guide. Use specific cases to accurately categorize tasks with distinct characteristics. Your evaluation should conclude with answering 3 questions: What are the individual ratings of the responses? After rating the responses individually, which one is better? What's your confidence level in your answers? Lastly, provide comments if necessary, to explain your responses or rating decisions. Make sure your comments answer why you chose a particular response and why one output is superior/inferior to another. Do not forget to review your task before submitting based on the Task Submission Checklist given. It includes steps like thoroughly reading the prompt, checking for grammatical errors, evaluating and comparing the responses, assessing your confidence in responding to this prompt, and writing a proper comment to elaborate on your decisions.";
